# DS&A!!!
Collection of LeetCode questions to ace the coding interview! - Created using [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub)

Using this as a place to store thoughts on the DS&A progress.

7/13/23 -- I don't feel right now that I am fully ready to be a software engineer because I am lacking in commitement to things like daily practice and learning more tools to get me a job. I feel inadequate right now and I want to change that. But how?

8/5/23 -- I am feeling more confident now that I have started at Blyss. I am feeling more motivated to code and am shjaking off the Wagner rejection. Looking forward now and not looking back!
